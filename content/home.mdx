# Welcome to Portmyfolio

Using this boilerplate, you will be able to create your own portfolio website in no time. You can easily customize the website by editing the markdown files in the **content** folder.

If you want to understand how to use this boilerplate, you can check the [documentation](https://docs.portmyfolio.com/introduction).

There are multiple routes here which define various sections of the website. You can edit them as per your requirements using the **port.json**.

If you want to learn to write _mdx_ you can check the [documentation](https://mdxjs.com/).
